How I used Tufte’s Rules:Show Your Data-The size of the hits point, which gets larger with more hits, works with the at-bat and home run data -Data has a clear pattern that makes sense, thus data shown correctlyAvoid Chartjunk-grid outlines were removed as they were distracting while observing the data and not necessary to understand the graph -after using facet_wrap, there were titles present on each separate graph (MLB, National, and American) these were removed because the colour scheme already interpreted this Separate layers -Dots of different intensity for number of hits-Dots are larger for higher number of hits, had all the hits been the same intensity it would be hard to distinguish Use Multiples-Separated HR vs AB by league and hit -Allows viewer to clearly distinguish between the leagues Utilize Colour-Each league was coloured differently according the colours in the MLB symbol for the American and National league, the colour of turf for MLB, and the colour of a baseball for the geometric line -Colours match MLB scheme -Colours serve a purpose
